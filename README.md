- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert Canady, I am currently an Electrical Engineering PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University. My projected graduation is May 2022.
- 👀 I’m interested in robust resource-constrained deep learning, in particular deploying robust models onto edge-based devices in the most optimal way by balancing robustness, resource usage, accuracy, and latency.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching how to make edge-based deep learning models robust to adversarial machine learning attacks 
- 💞️ I enjoy playing golf and basically just being outside, learning new things, cooking, and I just recently started brewing my own Kombucha (COVID hobby).
- 📫 My email is robert.e.canady@vanderbilt.edu if you want to contact me!
